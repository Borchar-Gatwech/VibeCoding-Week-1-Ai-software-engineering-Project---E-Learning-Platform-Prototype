📘 Overview

This project is a simple e-learning platform prototype built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows learners to view a list of courses, see course details, and mark courses as completed.
This project applies concepts from Week 1 VibeCoding, combining front-end technologies with AI-assisted design.
